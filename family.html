Family is a best person who support, love me unconditionally and believe me when others doubts me.  I am very lucky to be born in this family because they has been always by my side in up and downs and they also has made me a better person. Parents is my motivation booster and also my strenght because they always there when I need a support. I only have three siblings and I am a second child.  My older brother is Mustaqim and he was 23 years old, my youngest sister is Nurafifah and she is 19 years old and three of us is still studying.
